                  <div class="about-text">
                    <p>Dr. Mingshu Wang is a Reader in Geospatial Data Science with a background that includes a BSc from Nanjing University (China) and an MSc and Ph.D. from the University of Georgia (USA). He is also a Visiting Scholar at the University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Prior to his current position, he served as a Senior Lecturer (Associate Professor with Tenure) in Geospatial Data Science at the School of Geographical & Earth Sciences, University of Glasgow, UK (2021-2024). He was also a tenure-track Assistant Professor of Geodata Science at the Faculty of Geo-Information Science and Earth Observation (ITC), University of Twente, Netherlands (2018-2021).</p>
                    <p>His research focuses on advancing GIScience and big data analytics methods, including GeoAI, explainable artificial intelligence, and econometrics, to better understand urban systems. Dr. Wang approaches his work from a people-centric perspective through two main research areas. At the macro level, he examines the connection between urban spatial structures (such as urban polycentricity) and the economic, social, and environmental performance of city-regions. At the micro level, he studies how the built environment influences collective human behaviors like mobility and organizational vitality.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Wang has authored over 60 peer-reviewed articles in prestigious journals covering GIScience, Urban Studies/Planning, and related disciplines. Six of his papers have been recognized as Web of Science ESI Highly Cited Papers, placing them in the top 1% of all publications. He has been listed by Elsevier and Stanford University as one of the World's Top 2% most-cited scientists since 2022.</p>

  #     text: |
  #       Location-aware technologies and big data are transforming the ways we study and understand human behavior. At **GeoAI Lab**, our mission is to pioneer geospatial solutions to propel human mobility science, a burgeoning field that seeks to model and predict patterns of movement, as well as influence the ways people navigate through urban environments and the broader earth system.
